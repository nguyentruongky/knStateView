# knStateView


- `knStateView` is only for show state. (Single Responsibility principle) 
- I wrote it with high customization, and to be suitable for any situation. Users can customize the icon, title, description, or even replace everything with their own view without changing the class. (Open-Closed principle)
- Encapsulate the complicated things, publish simple things. (Encapsulation in OOP)
- Very easy to use. See `StateDemoController`. Define and show anytime and anywhere it is needed, leaving the rest for `knStateView`. 

Other classes are supported, however, you should ignore them. You can also have a look at `knConstraints` if you have enough time. This is my own lib for Auto Layout (used in a few commercial projects and companies).
